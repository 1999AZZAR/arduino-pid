# Arduino PID

This repository contains example projects demonstrating the implementation of PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control using Arduino. PID control is a widely used technique in control systems for achieving precise and accurate control of a system's output based on desired setpoints.

## Projects

The repository includes the following example projects:

1. Line Follower: This project demonstrates how to use PID control to create a line-following robot. The robot utilizes sensors to detect a line on the ground and adjusts its movements to stay on the line.

2. Motor Position Control: In this project, PID control is employed to control the position of a motor. The system uses feedback from an encoder or a position sensor to maintain a desired position accurately.

3. Wall Follower: The wall follower project showcases how PID control can be utilized to create a robot that follows along the walls of a maze or an environment. The robot adjusts its movements based on the proximity of the walls to maintain a specific distance.

Each project includes the necessary Arduino code, circuit diagrams, and additional documentation to help you understand and implement PID control for the specific application.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/1999AZZAR/arduino-pid.git
   ```

2. Choose the project you want to work on and navigate to its directory.

3. Open the Arduino IDE or your preferred Arduino development environment.

4. Connect the required hardware components as per the provided circuit diagrams.

5. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.

6. Follow the instructions in the project documentation to calibrate and adjust the PID parameters as needed.

7. Test and observe the behavior of the system based on the specific project's requirements.
